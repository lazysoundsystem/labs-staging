<h5>What lessons can be learned from 20 years of humanitarian reporting?</h5>

<h5>What interesting  trends can be observed?</h5>

ReliefWeb is organizing a data visualization competition based on its own human development data. The objective of this competition is to allow a broad cross-section of data users and artists to share with us their interpretation of human development data. The deadline for submission is 

The winners will be announced in a Reliefweb Blog and the visualization will be displayed in the RW trends section.

<h4>Guidelines for entry</h4>
Use the data provided below or the content offered in the ReliefWeb API to provide an original and thought provoking illustration of human development. 

You may address broad trends or focus on one theme or issue more specifically.

Participants are encouraged to examine the following questions:
How can the human development level of a country be best understood in one snapshot?
How might we best compare the indicators and data for different countries, and their evolution over time, and what insight might that yield?
How can you show the strengths of the different components that make up the indices for different countries, and how might that impact human-development focused policy in a country?
How can inequalities between countries, groups and genders be best illustrated and how might this impact the level of human development of a country?

Participants may think outside the ReliefWeb content and link to other data sources as well, whether they be from other organizations or from new or big data sources; keeping in mind that one component must be one ReliefWeb content.

<h4>Formats</h4>
Both in and interactive visualizations may be submitted.

For examples of existing visualizations, please visit our trends section.
